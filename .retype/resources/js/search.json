Compared to modern general purpose languages such as Python, Motoko is very strict about types. This have a good purpose as it helps preventing Motoko programs to go wrong as mentioned in the documentation page.","For example, each variable in a Motoko program carries an associated type, and this type is known statically, before the program executes. Each use of each variable is checked by the compiler to prevent runtime type errors, including null reference errors, invalid field access and the like."]},{"l":"Types in Motoko","p":["Generaly speaking, we can categorize types into two groups: primitive types non-primitive values. This text focuses on primitive types mainly so we will explain them in more detail in the next chapture.

Unbounded Integers","p":["Unbounded integers can be assigned with positive or negative numbers. There are some ways how to declare an integer variable:","Let's make a little exercise now. Write a funciton called add, that will take two integers as arguments and return a sum of these two numbers.","That was quite easy, right? Try to experiment with it in the Candid UI."]},{"l":"2. Unbounded Natural numbers","p":["Unbounded natural numbers can be assigned with positive numbers only. Motoko program will trap if you try to assign a negative number."]},{"l":"3. Bounded numbers","p":["As integers can also go below zero, we have space for 256 numbers too but in the range from -128 to 127.","But if you try this your program will fail because we are overflowing the maximum value:","For Nat16 the maximum value that can be assigned is 65 535 (2^ 16) and for Int16 we have minimum –32768 and maximum –32767. The same logic applies for 32 and 64 size of a type. This gives you understanding of what value can be assigned to a variable of specific type and gives you freedom to decide which one to use when designing your own program.","If you try to run this program, it will trap. Motoko Playground is well prepared for this type of situations, it doesn't let you execute the program and shows you an explanatory error message:","In Motoko, these bounded numbers types are available:","Int16","Int32","Int64","Int8","Keep in mind, even if you have a value that would fit into a smaller size Nat/Int, you can only assign it if it has the same type. Something like this will not work in Motoko:","Nat16","Nat32","Nat64","Nat8","Overflowing the Nat8 value in Motoko Playground","This means that you can declare a variable:","To explain the pattern, each type consist of Nat/Int and a number. This number represents quantity of bits that will be assigned in memory of the computer for this specific type. For example Nat8 variable can be only assigned with values ranging from 0 to 255. This comes from a formula 2^ 8 = 256 so the maximum number is 255 as we are starting from 0.","Unbounded numbers variables can be assigned theoretically with numbers of any size. There are situations when you don't need this. For example if you want to declare a variable that will represent an age of a person. This variable should never exceed a number greater than 200.

Tuples","p":["Tuples are simple objects that can contain multiple elements. These elements can be different types but you can't change number of elements after you declare it. You could create a simple tuple type to store name and surname for a person:","Then, you could easily create a tuple that will store not only name but also an age of the person as you can mix different types in a tuple:","However, for more complex situations you should consider creating your own object with named parameters which would be more readable. Tuples are usually used for simple use cases only."]},{"l":"2. Arrays","p":["Arrays are used for storing multiple values. Unlike tuples, they can contain only one specific type. You can define mutable and immutable arrays. The difference is that mutable arrays can be updated and immutable arrays cannot."]},{"i":"21-immutable-arrays","l":"2.1 Immutable arrays","p":["Here is how you define an immutable array:","Now as we defined an immutable array with the type of text, Motoko playground will not let you include any other value than text, also it doesn't let you to update the value:","Let's make a first excersise. Try to write a function called getDay, that will take a Nat as an argument and returns a name of the corresponding day.","Here we go. That was simple. You can notice 2 things – function is very well defined with types in the input as well as in the output, if you try to put anything else then natural number it is not going to work.","Also, we are using the query keyword in the function declaration which will make the function execution much faster. It is a very good idea to use query function anytime we are not trying to update values in the backend of our app."]},{"i":"21-mutable-arrays","l":"2.1 Mutable arrays","p":["Declaration of a mutable array is very similar to immutable array. The key difference is using the var keyword. Let's try to declare an immutable array.","Notice that now Motoko Playground allows you to reassign the array with different values. For example:","You could also change the number of elements inside freely. However, you still can't change an element inside individually as only the whole array is mutable but the content inside is not:","If you woul like to make a totally mutable array, you need to use the var keyword also inside the declaration. Here is the full working code of a mutable array:","If you run this code in you Motoko Playground and try tu run the function in the Candid UI, you should get \"Sunday\" for the index of 0.","If you'd like to make immutable array mutable and vice versa, you need to use functions from the Array section of the Motoko base library. Specifically it is thaw function to make array mutable and freeze function to make it immutable.","Notice that after using the thaw function, we can assign another array to the variable or even assign a value to a specific index. This wouldn't be possible with immutable array."]},{"l":"3. Records","p":["In Motoko, similarly to arrays, records objects can be mutable and immutable. Here is how you define an immutable object Person with attributes name, surname and age:","Analogically, if you want to have your object type mutable, you should use the var keyword. Let's redesign the example above so we are able to update the age of a person, name and surname cannot be changed:"]},{"l":"4. Variants","p":["When declaring an object above, we have to define all of the parameters so we have a person that has name AND surname AND age. Variants perform more like OR as we are expecting to get one of the values inside. Let's create a variant type Status that will have options single, married and divorced.","Now let's update the Person record type that we created before and add status as another parameter. We expect the status parameter to be updated later on in time.","With this design, we assured that each person can only have one of the available statuses."]},{"l":"5. Functions","p":["We've been already messing around simple functions in this and previous tutorials so you probably know how to define them. Let's go through some more examples so you can recognize different types of functions in Motoko."]},{"l":"Public and private functions","p":["Most of the functions that we defined so far were public, as there was no specific reason to make them private. Private functions are used for specific situations when you don't want to expose the private function to the public interface of your canister.","Example of a public function in Motoko, using the keyword public before the function definition:","If you would like to make your function private, you use the private keyword. You will notice that private functions also have an _ underscore character in their names. This is not required by the language itself but recommended as a naming convention."]},{"l":"Functions from Motoko base library","p":["Like we presented in the array section, there is plenty of functions available in the Motoko base library. There is a section for each type. These functions are called from the imported module like we did with the thaw function:","Notice that some functions require to define the data type in the <> brackets.","Go through the base library and check what is inside for each type. These funcitons are going to save your time when writing your programs. However, please respect that Motoko is still quite a fresh language and there is not yet as many functions available as for more mature languages."]},{"l":"Anonymous functions","p":["Anonymous functions are also known as lambdas. You define them for generic purpose in your program to complete small tasks. They are not ment to be part of the public interface."]},{"l":"6. Async values","p":["When canisters or actors communicate with each other on the Internet Computer, it happens asynchronously. Messagess are processed one after another (in sequence) in an isolated way.","Let's have a look at an example from the documentation page:","Await keyword is used to say to our program that we are expecting a value from the other service but the value will be returned in the future, that is why we have to wait for it. After the future value is assigned to our variables result1 and result2 the program knows that it can call the finalStep function."]},{"l":"7. Optional values","p":["Optional values are used when we are expecting a specific type but it can be null as well. Optional values are defined with question mark and can be mostly found in the record type declaration or in functions.","Let's extend the Person model from above and add another parameter partner that will point to another person instance. Naturally, single persons will not have a partner so we must keep this parameter optional.","Optional values play significant roles also in function definitions as funciton can as well expect or return a null value.

We are going to learn how to serve a SVG image over HTTP(s) directly from your canister. Yes – canisters can serve web content over HTTP! You are probably familiar with that as it is one of the main advantages of the Internet Computer over the other blockchains. But there is also a http_request() function that you can use in Motoko to define how exactly is your canister going to behave when contacted over HTTP protocol.","This could be useful when you want to serve custom SVG images or define custom api endpoint over the URL. Serving a dynamic NFT file is what we're going to do now.","We are going to use Motoko Playground for deploying the code, this will give you a quick start without needing to setting up your local enviroment."]},{"l":"HTTP Requests","p":["We are going to start with this skeleton template used for educational purposes during the Motoko Bootcamp event.","The template contains of two files, first the module file http.mo that contains types needed for HTTP communication from the canister.","If the code seems too exotic to you, please check this video that is explaining basics of HTTP protocol. The most key part for our case in this tutorial are the Request and Response types that play the main role in our simple HTTP communication.","The second file is your main.mo file that loads the module http and contains a simple function http_request that puts it all together.","Now, try to deploy the code in the Motoko Playground. Let's ignore the Candid UI for now and focus on the Log message with the canister ID: Code installed at canister id wch4f-miaaa-aaaab-qadfa-cai. Your canister ID will be of course different. Copy your canister ID and create this URL following this pattern https://<<CANISTER ID>>.raw.ic0.app/:","If all goes fine and you open your URL in your browser you should see the Hello world message.","Notice that there is a \"raw\" keyword in the URL. Raw in the URL means we are serving non certified assets. This certification means that IC guarantees that you are getting right data. Certification can be expensive as it can cost a lot of assets so it only makes sense when serving very important data. You would need to implement a hash function for certification which is beyond the scope of this tutorial."]},{"l":"SVG image","p":["Now, let's put some SVG image into works. SVGs are basically text files that carry vector information about some visual. You can easily find any SVG file online and use it or you can use the same as we.

You just served a SVG file over HTTP on the Internet Computer."]},{"l":"Dynamic SVG","p":["To demonstrate the power of serving SVG images over HTTP, we can now make a simple example of dynamically changing the SVG color.","Notice that there is a color definition at the beginning of our curve (path) in the SVG format fill=' black'. We can make this to change dynamically based on the number in the URL requested to the canister.","To start, let's create an array that will contain some colors:","Now, let's define a function make_svg that will take a color as a text argument and returns colored SVG if it finds it in our colors array. If it doesn't find the color in our array, it will return the default black color.","We are first looping through our colors array to find out if color is in it. If it is found we assign it as a result_color, if it is not inside we will use \"black\" as default. Notice that we are contatenating the SVG string with the color name.","Now let's change the http_request() function, so it gets the /path from the request and call the color_svg function, that will return the SVG code with the right color.","Now deploy your code and open the canister URL in another window of your browser again.
